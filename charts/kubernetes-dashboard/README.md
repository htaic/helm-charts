This is brief overview of the kubernetes-dashboard.

Regardless of the method or how we get there, objectively we want the dashboard:

- Something that is accessible outside of the cluster (Similar to trafik dashboard)
- Has some sort of authentication/authorization (Allow granularity of users/groups)
- Stable URL
Confluence outlines current state:https://htw-cloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISAAS/pages/140935219/Kubernetes+Dashboard

Down the line:
- Include this into a chart and automated the deployments
- Could be a subchart into baselines?
